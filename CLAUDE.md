# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a new repository called "vup" that currently has minimal structure. The repository appears to be in its initial stages with only a README.md file containing the project name.

## Development Methodology

This project follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles. When implementing features:

1. Write tests first before implementing functionality
2. Ensure tests fail initially (Red phase)
3. Write minimal code to make tests pass (Green phase)
4. Refactor code while keeping tests passing (Refactor phase)
5. Maintain high test coverage throughout the development process

## Development Setup

Since this is a new repository with no existing code or configuration files, the development setup will depend on the technology stack chosen for the project. Future instances of Claude Code should:

1. Check for any newly added configuration files (package.json, Cargo.toml, requirements.txt, etc.) to understand the project's technology stack
2. Look for build configuration files to determine how to build and run the project
3. Search for test frameworks and testing patterns once code is added

## Project Structure

Currently, the repository only contains:
- `README.md` - Contains only the project name "vup"

As the project develops, this file should be updated with:
- Build and development commands
- Testing instructions
- High-level architecture decisions
- Key dependencies and their purposes
